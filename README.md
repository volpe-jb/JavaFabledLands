# JavaFabledLands

Fork of a fork of the [Java Fabled Lands (JaFL) project](https://github.com/thomaslaurenson/JavaFabledLands.git`) (http://flapp.sourceforge.net/ "Java Fabled Lands (JaFL) project") by Jonathan Mann. JavaFabledLands is a game engine for the Fabled Lands gamebooks series, a type of choose you own adventure gamebooks.

## Fabled Land Gamebooks

Fabled Lands is a series of gamebook written by Dave Morris and Jamie Thompson and published by Pan Books (a division of Macmilliam Publishers). The Fabled Lands series consists of six gamebooks (although a total of 12 were initially planned). The books were released in 1995 and 1996.

## The JavaFabledLands project
The primary reason for this fork is to develop an Android app for this fantastic solo rpg adventure.

#### Project Roadmap

I have a variety of goals to accomplish:

1. Build an Android version.
2. Allow users to save a crumb-trail of their adventures.
3. Users can create & save notes.
4. Provide an interactive map with a "You are here" tag.
5. Fix any bugs that appear.
